# 🤖 Real-Time Hand Tracking with MediaPipe and OpenCV

### 👋 About the Project
This project is a **Real-Time Hand Tracking** system that uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to detect and display 21 hand landmarks, along with their connections. The system works seamlessly with a webcam and calculates the live frame rate (FPS) to ensure smooth performance.

✨ **Features**:
- Real-time detection of hand landmarks 🖐️
- Customizable drawing specs for landmarks and connections 🎨
- Live FPS display ⏱️

## 🛠️ **Installation Steps**
To run this project on your system, follow these easy steps:

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

### 2️⃣ Install Required Libraries
Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
```

- **`opencv-python`**: Used for video capture and frame processing.
- **`mediapipe`**: Google's framework for machine learning models, including hand tracking.

### 3️⃣ Clone the Repository
Download the project by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/Real-Time-Hand-Tracking.git
cd Real-Time-Hand-Tracking
```

---

## 🚀 **How to Run**
Run the Python script using:

```bash
python hand_tracking.py
```

🔹 A window will open displaying:
- Detected hand landmarks (red circles)
- Hand connections (green lines)
- Live FPS for smooth performance

Press **`q`** or close the window to stop the program.

## 🧩 **Code Overview**
Here’s a quick breakdown of the main sections:

1. **Capture Video**: OpenCV initializes the webcam.
2. **Hand Detection**: MediaPipe processes each frame to detect hands.
3. **Drawing Landmarks**: Custom specs for circles (red) and connections (green).
4. **FPS Calculation**: Frame rate is calculated and displayed in real-time.
5. **Visualization**: The video feed with hand tracking and FPS overlay is shown.

## 🎯 **Output Preview**
You should see:
- A real-time video feed 🖥️
- Your hand with red landmark points and green connections 🌟
- FPS counter displayed on the top left corner 🎯

Example of hand landmarks:
```
ID: 0, X: 250, Y: 300
ID: 1, X: 280, Y: 350
...
```
